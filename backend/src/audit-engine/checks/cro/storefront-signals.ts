/**
 * ─── CRO · Rendered storefront signals ───────────────────────────────
 * Three checks that ask the same shape of question — "is this element actually on the page?" —
 * and so share one detection engine rather than three near-identical files.
 *
 *   trust     review widgets, trust badges, policy links, contact details
 *   wishlist  a save-for-later control
 *   locator   a store-finder page or widget
 *
 * DETECTION IS EVIDENCE-BASED AND CONSERVATIVE.
 * Each signal is a set of markers looked for in the page's own rendered text, its link targets,
 * and its script hosts. A signal is reported PRESENT only when a marker is actually found. It is
 * never inferred from the Admin API: a Shopify policy record proves a policy exists, not that the
 * theme links to it; an installed app proves an app is installed, not that its widget renders.
 *
 * ABSENCE IS REPORTED AS ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE, and the wording says so. A wishlist implemented by
 * an app whose markup gives no recognisable marker would be missed, and the finding is phrased so
 * a merchant who has one is told what Scorelo looked for rather than told they do not have it.
