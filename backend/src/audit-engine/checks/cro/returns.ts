/**
 * ─── CRO · Returns flow ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Reads the store's real refund policy through `read_content` and measures whether it answers the
 * questions a shopper asks BEFORE buying. A returns policy that exists but does not say how long
 * you have, who pays postage, or how to start a return does not remove the hesitation it is there
 * to remove — so presence alone is not the measurement.
 *
 * THE UNIT IS THE SIGNAL, NOT THE POLICY. A store has exactly one refund policy, and scoring
 * "1 of 1 policies" would produce a binary 0 or 100 that says nothing actionable. The CRO evidence
 * table is built for this shape — its columns are `surface / signal / coverage / status /
 * recommendation` (croTables.ts) — so each row here is one question the policy should answer.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE
 * The rendered storefront. Whether the policy is actually LINKED from the product page, cart or
 * footer needs the theme's rendered HTML, which requires the storefront crawl Scorelo does not
 * have yet. This check reads the policy Shopify holds, and says so in its summary rather than
 * implying it verified the shopper's path to it.
 *
 * DETECTION IS DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE. Each signal is matched against the policy's plain text
 * with wide alternatives; a policy that says the same thing in unusual wording can be missed. A
 * missed signal understates the score, which is the safe direction to be wrong in — the opposite
 * (claiming a policy answers something it does not) would send a merchant into a conversion
 * problem believing it was already solved.
