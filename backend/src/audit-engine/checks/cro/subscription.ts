/**
 * ─── CRO · Subscription opportunity ──────────────────────────────────
 * Measures how consistently a store's EXISTING subscription programme is applied across the
 * catalogue, using each product's real `sellingPlanGroupCount` from the Admin API.
 *
 * THIS CHECK REFUSES TO INVENT A FAILURE. Most stores do not sell subscriptions, and they are
 * right not to — a one-off fashion purchase has no recurring form. Scoring every product as
 * unhealthy for lacking a selling plan would manufacture a catalogue-wide defect out of a
 * deliberate business decision, and would drag the CRO pillar score down for a store with
 * nothing wrong with it. So:
 *
 *   No selling plans anywhere  ->  'unavailable', with a reason that says there is no programme
 *                                  to audit. Excluded from the pillar average (scoring.ts), never
 *                                  rendered as a zero.
 *   Some products enrolled     ->  measured. The unit is the product, healthy means enrolled, and
 *                                  the finding is about the products left out of a programme the
 *                                  merchant has already decided they want.
 *
 * The second case is the one worth flagging: a store that set up subscriptions and then enrolled
 * a third of the eligible catalogue is leaking recurring revenue on the rest, and the gap is
 * usually invisible because nothing in the admin lists what was skipped.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE
 * Whether the theme actually renders a subscribe-and-save widget on the product page, and what
 * discount each plan offers — the first needs the storefront crawl, the second needs the selling
 * plan detail this check does not fetch. It measures enrolment, and says so.
