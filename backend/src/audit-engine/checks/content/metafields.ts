/**
 * ─── Content · Metafield completeness ────────────────────────────────
 * Measures, for every metafield the store actually uses, how much of the catalog fills it in.
 *
 * THE UNIT HERE IS THE METAFIELD, NOT THE PRODUCT — which is unlike every other check so far, and
 * is dictated by the UI: contentTables.ts declares columns `field / label / category / applicable
 * / missing / coverage / status`, i.e. one row per metafield definition with a coverage figure.
 * So `analyzedCount` is the number of distinct metafield keys in use, and a key is "healthy" when
 * its coverage clears the completeness bar.
 *
 * WHY DEFINITIONS ARE INFERRED FROM USAGE
 * The snapshot carries each product's metafields but not the shop's metafield DEFINITIONS (that
 * is a separate Admin API resource the provider does not fetch). So "which metafields should this
 * catalog have?" is answered empirically: any namespace.key present on at least one product is
 * treated as a field the store intends to use, and coverage is measured against the whole catalog.
 *
 * The honest consequence: a metafield defined in Shopify but filled in on ZERO products is
 * invisible to this check — it cannot be distinguished from a field that does not exist. That is
 * stated in the summary rather than papered over.
 *
 * BANDS (status vocabulary matches contentTables.ts):
 *   coverage < 50%   Critical Gap
 *   coverage < 90%   Gap
 *   coverage ≥ 90%   Complete
