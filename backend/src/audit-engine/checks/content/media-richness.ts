/**
 * ─── Content · Media richness ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Scores how many images each product carries.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED
 * `Product.images` from the Admin API — the product's own media, which is what a product page
 * gallery renders.
 *
 * BANDS (status vocabulary matches contentTables.ts: Rich / Limited / Missing Media):
 *   0 images     Missing Media
 *   1-2 images   Limited
 *   3+ images    Rich
 *
 * Three is the threshold at which a gallery can show a product from more than one angle, which is
 * the practical difference between "there is a photo" and "I can see what I am buying".
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT: the `video` column the UI declares is reported as "No" for every row. The
 * snapshot models images only (SnapshotImage), so video presence is genuinely UNKNOWN here — it
 * is not measured and must not be scored. Adding video would require extending the provider to
 * read Product.media union types, not guessing from image data.
