/**
 * ─── Content · Blog freshness ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Scores how recently each article was published or updated.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED
 * `Article.updatedAt`, falling back to `publishedAt` — the most recent evidence that anyone
 * touched the piece. Age is measured against the SNAPSHOT's capturedAt, not wall-clock time, so
 * re-scoring the same snapshot always yields the same answer (the scoring engine is required to
 * be deterministic, and `new Date()` here would quietly break that).
 *
 * BANDS (status vocabulary matches contentTables.ts: Fresh / Aging / Stale):
 *   ≤ 90 days   Fresh
 *   ≤ 365 days  Aging
 *   > 365 days  Stale
 *
 * These are editorial conventions, not ranking rules. Freshness matters for content that makes
 * time-sensitive claims; an evergreen guide can be years old and perfectly good. The check
 * reports age honestly and leaves that judgement to the merchant rather than asserting decay.
