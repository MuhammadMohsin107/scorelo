/**
 * ─── Speed · Image Optimization ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Scores product imagery on the two signals the Admin API genuinely exposes:
 *
 *   1. DIMENSIONS — an image whose pixel area far exceeds what any product page renders is
 *      shipped weight for nothing. The threshold (> ~5.5MP, i.e. beyond ~2048x2560) marks a
 *      source image no storefront breakpoint will ever display at full size.
 *   2. FORMAT — inferred from the CDN URL's extension. JPEG/PNG sources are flagged when
 *      oversized; WebP/AVIF sources are treated as modern.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT, stated in the summary too: TRANSFERRED BYTES are not visible here. Shopify's
 * CDN transcodes and resizes on delivery, so real byte weight is a storefront/lab measurement
 * (blocked while the storefront is password-protected). What is measured is the source asset
 * the CDN has to work from — a real, actionable signal, but not a page-weight figure, and this
 * check never pretends otherwise.
 *
 * The unit is the IMAGE, not the product: one product with nine heavy images is nine problems.
