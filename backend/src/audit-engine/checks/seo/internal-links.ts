/**
 * ─── SEO · Internal links ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Reads the anchors the theme actually renders, and verifies where the internal ones lead.
 *
 * A LINK IS ONLY CALLED BROKEN WHEN ITS TARGET WAS ACTUALLY REQUESTED AND ANSWERED WITH AN ERROR.
 * The crawler verifies a sample of internal targets and records the status it received; a target
 * that was never checked, or whose check failed at the network level, is recorded as status 0 and
 * is reported as UNVERIFIED, never as broken. Telling a merchant a link is dead when Scorelo
 * simply did not look is the exact failure this whole engine is built to avoid — and it is the
 * easiest mistake to make here, because "not 200" reads like "broken".
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED
 *   · orphan-ish pages   crawled pages that nothing else links to
 *   · broken targets     internal links whose target really returned 4xx/5xx
 *   · thin linking       pages with almost no internal links out
 *   · anchor quality     "click here" / "read more" links, which carry no signal
 *
 * The unit is the PAGE, so the score answers "how many of my pages link well?".
