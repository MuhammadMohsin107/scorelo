/**
 * ─── SEO · Title Tags ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Scores the title tag of every indexable page (products, collections, pages, articles).
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY MEASURED
 * The storefront's rendered <title> is not readable through the Admin API, so this check scores
 * the value that determines it: Shopify's SEO title override when set, and otherwise the
 * resource's own title, which is what a stock theme falls back to. That fallback is why a null
 * override is NOT reported as "missing" — the page still renders a title.
 *
 * LENGTH THRESHOLDS (30-60 characters) are an SEO readability heuristic, not a Google ranking
 * rule: Google truncates the displayed title at roughly 600px, so very long titles get cut off in
 * the snippet and very short ones waste the space. The same two constants are used by the
 * frontend's bulk-fix validator (BulkFixWorkflow.tsx) so the audit and the editor never disagree
 * about what "acceptable" means.

/**
 * ─── The theme's title suffix ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Most Shopify themes render `<title>` as the page's title followed by the shop name — "Krasa
 * Charcoal Facewash – Deep Clean, Clear & Oil-Free Skin – My Nutrition Store". Those trailing
 * characters count against the same truncation budget as the merchant's own words, so scoring the
 * Shopify field alone under-reports every page on the store by the length of the suffix. A title
 * measured at 59 characters and called healthy can be 80 on the rendered page and get cut off.
 *
 * IT IS MEASURED, NEVER ASSUMED. Nothing here knows the shop's name, the separator, or whether
 * the theme appends anything at all — some do not, and some prepend instead. The suffix is
 * recovered by comparing what the crawl actually LOADED against what the Admin API holds for the
 * same resource, and it is only believed when several independent pages agree on the same string.
 * Without a crawl, or without agreement, there is no suffix and the check scores exactly as it
 * did before.
 *
 * This is the one thing this check reads from rendered output, and it respects the rule in
 * storefront/types.ts: the rendered value is read from the crawl, never inferred from Admin data.
