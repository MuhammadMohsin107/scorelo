/**
 * ─── Crawl target discovery ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Decides WHICH storefront URLs an audit is allowed to fetch.
 *
 * Targets come from the Admin snapshot — the merchant's own products, collections, pages and
 * articles — plus the storefront root. Nothing is discovered by following links, which is what
 * keeps the crawl bounded, same-origin, and free of anything the merchant did not publish.
 *
 * WHY THE MIX MATTERS MORE THAN THE COUNT
 * The crawl budget is small next to a real catalogue, so how it is spent decides what can be
 * measured. Taking the first N products would mean a store's collections, pages and blog were
 * never seen, and every template-level defect on those page types would be invisible while the
 * audit reported itself complete. Sampling across page types instead means each TEMPLATE is
 * represented — which is the level at which theme defects actually live, since one product
 * template renders every product.
