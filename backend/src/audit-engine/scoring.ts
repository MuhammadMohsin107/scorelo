// ─── Scorelo score engine ────────────────────────────────────────────
// ONE scoring mechanism for the whole product. Individual checks report facts
// (how many resources were analyzed, how many were healthy, what findings resulted)
// and this module — and only this module — turns facts into scores.
//
//   raw check results        analyzed / healthy counts + findings
//          ↓
//   severity cap             worst finding severity bounds the score
//          ↓
//   sub-pillar score         round(healthy / analyzed * 100), then capped
//          ↓
//   pillar score             mean of that pillar's MEASURED sub-pillar scores
//          ↓
//   overall score            mean of MEASURED pillar scores
//
// Properties: deterministic (no randomness/time), bounded (always 0-100),
// explainable (every number traces to counts + findings), testable (pure functions).
//
// Sub-pillars whose status is 'unavailable' are EXCLUDED from every average rather
// than counted as 0. Counting them as 0 would invent a bad score out of missing data;
// excluding them keeps "not measured" honestly separate from "measured and failing".
