 * There is no device parser and no geolocation here on purpose. A "device" string is a guess
 * derived from a header anyone can set, and a location needs a geo-IP database this project does
 * not carry — presenting either as fact on a security page would be inventing evidence about a
 * customer's own account. What is genuinely known gets recorded; what is not returns null.
 *
 * Every value produced here is stored as-is and rendered as-is. Null means "we do not know",
 * and the UI says exactly that.

 *
 *   X-Forwarded-For: <real client>, <edge proxy>, <server.cjs hop>
 *
 * Express's own `req.ip` respects `trust proxy`, which this app does not set — so it would report
 * the nearest hop, not the customer. Reading the header's first entry is what actually answers
 * "where did this person sign in from".
 *
 * CAVEAT, STATED PLAINLY: X-Forwarded-For is client-settable. A caller can put anything in it, so
 * this value is descriptive context on a security page, never an access-control input. Nothing in
 * this codebase makes a decision based on it.
