/**
 * ─── Access scopes ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Minimum set required by the data Scorelo actually reads. Every entry below is justified by a
 * resource the provider fetches; nothing is requested "just in case", because each extra scope
 * is a permission the merchant must grant and a question Shopify asks at app review.
 *
 *   read_products     Product + Collection objects: title, descriptionHtml, seo{title,description},
 *                     media alt text, metafields. Feeds SEO (title tags, meta descriptions, image
 *                     alt text), Content (product/collection descriptions, metafields) and CRO.
 *   read_content      Page, Blog and Article objects. Feeds SEO (page titles/meta) and Content
 *                     (blog freshness, media richness). Also implicitly grants
 *                     read_online_store_pages, so that scope is NOT requested separately.
 *   read_themes       Online store theme data. Feeds Speed (theme weight, app bloat).
 *   read_metaobjects  Metaobject instances. Feeds Content (metafields/metaobjects) and
 *                     AI Discovery (structured answerable content).
 *   read_legal_policies  Shop policies (refund, shipping, privacy, terms). Feeds CRO (returns
 *                     flow). `shopPolicies` used to be readable under read_content and now
 *                     requires this scope of its own — without it Shopify denies the field
 *                     outright, so the returns check reports "not measured" rather than scoring.
 *
 * ─── Write scopes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * These are what turn an approved fix into an actual change on the storefront. Without them the
 * flow can propose and record a value but never save it — which is the state this app shipped in:
 * `ai_fix_proposals` reached `approved` and stopped there.
 *
 *   write_products    seo{title,description} on Product and Collection, through productUpdate and
 *                     collectionUpdate.
 *   write_content     Page and Article search listings. Neither has an `seo` field on its update
 *                     input — verified against the 2026-07 schema — so their listing is written as
 *                     the `global.title_tag` / `global.description_tag` metafields, which is both
 *                     what Shopify's own SEO guide documents AND exactly what this app already
 *                     READS in PAGES_QUERY/ARTICLES_QUERY. Write field and read field are the same
 *                     field, so an applied fix is visible to the very next audit. Implicitly
 *                     grants write_online_store_pages, so that is NOT requested separately.
 *
 * SCOPE IS STILL CHECKED PER FIELD AT RUNTIME. `FIELD_RULES[].writeScope` names what each field
 * needs and fixability.service.ts compares it against `shopify_connections.scope` — what the
 * merchant ACTUALLY consented to. Adding a scope here grants nothing on existing connections:
 * Shopify only issues scopes on fresh consent, so a store connected before this change stays
 * read-only until it reconnects, and Apply refuses with a reason rather than failing at Shopify.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT requested:
 *   write_themes — Speed findings are diagnostic, and editing theme code from an audit tool is a
 *     far larger blast radius than a bounded metadata field. Nothing here proposes theme changes.
 *   read_orders, read_customers — Protected Customer Data. They force a Level 2 approval review
 *     with extra security obligations, and until approved Shopify redacts the fields anyway. No
 *     Scorelo check reads an order or a customer.
 *   read_product_listings, read_shipping, read_locations, read_price_rules, read_discounts,
 *   read_translations — no code path reads any of them.
 *
 * Changing this list changes what Shopify asks the merchant to approve. Existing connections keep
 * the scope string they were granted (stored per-connection), so a widened list only takes effect
 * for merchants who reconnect.
