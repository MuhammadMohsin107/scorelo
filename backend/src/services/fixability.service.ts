 * ─── "What can Scorelo actually do about this finding?" ──────────────

 * Answered once per request and attached to every finding, so the UI can tell a merchant what is
 * possible BEFORE they open anything. Without it the AI capability is invisible: a customer only
 * discovers that Scorelo can draft a value by opening a drawer and noticing a button, which means
 * most of them never discover it at all.
 *
 * Every input is a fact we hold:
 *   · the field allow-list           (fix-policy.ts)
 *   · the scopes the merchant granted (shopify_connections.scope — what they actually consented to)
 *   · whether a model is configured   (env)
 *
 * No model is consulted to produce this. Deciding what may be written to a live storefront is the
 * one question that must never depend on a generated answer.
