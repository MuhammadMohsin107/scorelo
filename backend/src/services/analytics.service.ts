/**
 * ─── Google Analytics 4 · reading real data ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Every number here came from Google in the request that produced it. No cached sample, no seeded
 * row, no fallback: a store with no connection reports `connected: false`, and a property with no
 * traffic reports zeroes that are genuinely zero.
 *
 * WHY GA4 IS WORTH READING ALONGSIDE SEARCH CONSOLE, given both are Google and both are about
 * traffic: Search Console ends at the click. It knows which query was searched, which page was
 * shown and where it ranked — and nothing at all about what happened next. GA4 starts there: did
 * the visit engage, which landing page took it, did it convert. A page can rank well, earn the
 * click, and lose the visitor immediately, and Search Console reports that as a success.
 *
 * ─── Two APIs, because they answer different questions ───────────────
 *   Admin API   which properties may this account read      analyticsadmin.googleapis.com
 *   Data API    what did that property record               analyticsdata.googleapis.com
 *
 * The Data API cannot enumerate properties, so without the Admin API the merchant would have to
 * paste a numeric id by hand — and a typo would silently report another company's traffic. Both
 * must be enabled on the Cloud project or the first call 403s with SERVICE_DISABLED.
 *
 * ─── The lag is real and is not hidden ───────────────────────────────
 * GA4 finalises data on roughly a 24-48 hour delay. Ranges here end two days back and the dates
 * actually used are returned, rather than quietly requesting today and presenting the partial tail
 * as a collapse in traffic. Same rule, and the same reason, as DATA_LAG_DAYS in
 * search-console.service.ts.
