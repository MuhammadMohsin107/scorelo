/**
 * ─── Applying an approved fix to the merchant's store ────────────────
 *
 * THE STEP THAT WAS MISSING. Everything before this existed: the audit finds a gap, a value is
 * proposed, a human approves it, and the proposal lands in `ai_fix_proposals` with status
 * `approved`. Nothing then wrote it to Shopify, so `approved` was where the pipeline stopped and
 * the merchant's storefront never changed. The schema anticipated this — `applied` and `failed`
 * have always been valid statuses — but the engine that moves a row between them did not exist.
 *
 * ─── WHY AN APPLIED FIX ACTUALLY MOVES THE SCORE ─────────────────────
 * Because the field written here is the SAME field the audit reads back. That is not a hope, it is
 * a property of the mapping below:
 *
 *   product / collection   written: productUpdate / collectionUpdate `seo { description }`
 *                          read:    PRODUCTS_QUERY / COLLECTIONS_QUERY `seo { description }`
 *   page / article         written: `global.description_tag` metafield
 *                          read:    PAGES_QUERY / ARTICLES_QUERY metafields(namespace: "global")
 *
 * Page and Article genuinely have no `seo` field on their update inputs — verified against the
 * 2026-07 schema — which is exactly why shopify.provider.ts already reads their listing from the
 * `global` metafields. Writing anywhere else would produce a change the next audit could not see,
 * and a merchant staring at an unchanged score after a successful apply.
 *
 * The audit itself re-fetches live (`buildSnapshot()` has no cache) and the meta-description check
 * reads Admin API data rather than crawled HTML, so there is no CDN or theme delay between the
 * write and the next run seeing it.
 *
 * ─── WHAT THIS SERVICE REFUSES TO DO ─────────────────────────────────
 * Every write is bounded by the same allow-list the proposal passed on the way in, re-checked here
 * rather than trusted. A stored row is not evidence that it is still valid: the field rules may
 * have tightened, and a row could in principle be edited outside this flow. `validateProposedValue`
 * runs again immediately before the mutation, so a value that would not pass today is never sent to
 * a live storefront.
