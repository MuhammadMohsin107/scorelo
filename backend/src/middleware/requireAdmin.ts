/**
 * ─── Platform-admin authorization ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `authenticate` proves WHO is calling. This proves WHAT THEY MAY DO, and the two are kept as
 * separate middleware because they answer separate questions — an authenticated customer reaching
 * an admin route must be refused, not admitted.
 *
 * THE GRANT LIVES IN MYSQL, in `users.is_platform_admin`, which defaults to false and is written
 * by nothing in this codebase: no signup path, no API, no seed. Becoming an admin is a deliberate
 * UPDATE an operator runs against the database. There are no credentials here — no admin password,
 * no shared key, no environment-variable allow-list of emails — because any of those would be a
 * second authentication system sitting alongside the real one.
 *
 * `users.role` IS NOT CONSULTED. It is a Settings → Profile label that defaults to the literal
 * string 'Administrator' on every row (see db/schema.ts), so reading it here would grant platform
 * admin to every account in existence. That near-miss is why this check names its own column.
 *
 * READ FRESH ON EVERY REQUEST, not carried in the access token. A revoked flag then takes effect
 * at the caller's next request, instead of whenever a fifteen-minute JWT happens to expire. The
 * cost is one indexed primary-key read per admin call, which is the right trade for a surface this
 * privileged and this low-traffic.
 *
 * MOCK AUTH IS NOT A BYPASS. `authenticate` can put a fixed user id on the request in
 * development (env.mockAuthEnabled), and this middleware still requires that id to belong to a
 * real row whose flag is genuinely set — so the development shortcut cannot conjure an admin.
