 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT.
 *
 * The SEO schema AUDIT (audit-engine/checks/seo/schema.ts) answers "what structured data does the
 * storefront actually render?" by reading crawled HTML. It stays exactly as it is.
 *
 * This engine answers a different question: "what structured data SHOULD Scorelo generate for this
 * store, from its real Shopify data?" The two meet later — once generated schema is published, the
 * existing audit is what proves it reached the page. Neither replaces the other, and this file
 * deliberately imports nothing from the audit so the two cannot grow into one tangled thing.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE INVENTS DATA. A template declares WHERE each property's value comes from; the
 * resolver reads that place in a real StoreSnapshot. When a source holds nothing, the property is
 * omitted and the reason is recorded — a schema that quietly ships a placeholder price or an
 * invented GTIN is worse than no schema, because a merchant cannot see that it is wrong and
 * Google's rich-result eligibility turns on exactly those fields being true.

 * from a list of real, named Shopify fields cannot write a mapping that silently resolves to
 * nothing — and Scorelo can tell them, before publishing, which properties will actually be
 * populated for their catalogue.
