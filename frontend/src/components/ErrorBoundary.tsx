/**
 * ─── Last line of defence ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A single component throwing during render unmounts the ENTIRE React tree —
 * React's documented behaviour since 16, and it produces a completely blank page with nothing on
 * screen to explain it or click. That is what a customer signing in on a new laptop saw: one
 * `.filter` call against a value that was not an array, and the whole application vanished.
 *
 * A crash is a bug either way. The difference an error boundary makes is between "the product is
 * broken" and "this screen is broken, here is a way out" — and between a support ticket that says
 * "white page" and one that carries the actual error text.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a route-level boundary: it wraps the whole app because the failures worth
 * catching here are the ones that take everything down. A reload is offered because most render
 * crashes come from state that a fresh load will not reproduce.
