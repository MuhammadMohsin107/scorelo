 * property, no placeholder metric and no fallback row: a store with no connection reports
 * `connected: false`, and a property with no traffic reports zeroes that are genuinely zero.
 *
 * THERE IS NO CONNECT CALL HERE, deliberately. GA4 rides on the SAME Google connection Search
 * Console uses — one consent screen, one token pair, two APIs — so connecting and disconnecting
 * live in google.repository.ts. Duplicating them would imply a second grant to manage.
